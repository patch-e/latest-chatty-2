- Mod requests send a reindex request to winchatty regardless of API selection

- Thread traversal buttons now point up and down instead of left and right
- Resolved the updating of the in-app badge count on the messages icon for unread messages

3.4.13

3.4.6
====

3.4.5
====
- UI darkened by default, dark mode removed (will be going farther with this to allow a white theme similar to stock iOS 7 apps)
- Typography updated for less Helvetica Neue Light and more Helvetica Neue Regular (iOS 7 system font)
- Project converted from manual reference counting to automatic reference counting (ARC) -- Thanks Yanks!
- Removal of SBJSON dependency -- Thanks Yanks!
- Removal of RegexKit dependency -- Thanks Yanks!
- Testing out moving the thread timestamp to the bottom right of cell (like the iPad does), not certain this will remain
- Recent Search saving is now controllable via a user setting
- Settings preferences alphabetized

3.4.4
====

3.4.3
====
- 1px blue dot beside the chat bubbles in Stories view fixed
- Status bar loading indicator appears/disappears as necessary now
- Loading spinner in Browser view removed completely in favor of the status bar loading indicator (which means there is no loading indicator visible when Browser view is full screen after scrolling down the page). I'd like to make a thin progress bar at the top of the screen similar to iOS 7 Safari in the end.
- Testing an open source component to replace the loading overlays. They are visible when loading a main section, loading a thread, or tagging a thread only for now.
- Super Secret Fart Mode added (how to enable it is a secret!)

3.4.2
====
- Search view UI has been touched up, search button under the terms/author/parent table has been removed in favor of a top right navigation bar button to do the same thing. This top right button hides when on the "Recent" segment.
- Browser view now hides all bars (status bar, nav bar, tool bar) when starting to scroll down a page above a certain velocity. Starting a scroll back up the page with a certain velocity will bring back the bars. It's kind of like iOS 7 Safari but not as good because I suck.

3.4.1
====
- Open source pull to refresh component ditched in favor of built-in SDK refresh control (no more "last refresh" date label though however)
- SDK refresh control stays visible until refresh completes and the loading overlay is not used during refresh
- Thread/replies separator bar and all buttons are swipe-able up/down to move bar
- Thread/replies now even spaces all buttons and ditched the grippy handle in the center due to the above change
- Bunch of under the cover memory management clean up crap, it could be crashy?
- Settings now pans text fields into view when focused, and animates the keyboard away on touch scroll
- New app icon

3.4.0
====
- Initial iOS 7 rewrite build
